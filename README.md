[Recruiters Black List](http://recruitersblacklist.com) is THE community sourced list of IT recruiters email address and phone numbers.

## Reason

The purpose of this project is to gather all the recruiters emails and phone numbers that are spamming out phones. The sad reality is that if you are in IT, once you put your resume online, the calls and emails do not stop. It doesn't matter if you take them off or say you're not on the market, they will keep flooding in. Your data has been spread and now you may be getting dozens or hundreds of spam emails a day. This list is for enabling during the times when we are not actively looking and we can take it off when we are looking for a job. 

## List

The list is provided in a CSV format. Future goal is to make lists for each mail provider for easy import.

## Contribute

Feel free to contribute, just open a PR with the added rows of data. We will do investigation to make sure that it's a recruiter and then add them. 

We currently have 3 types for recruiter_type
- recruiting_company
- spam_recruiting_company
- inhouse_recruiting_company

### recruiting_company
A company that does primarily IT recruiting for other firms and sends less than 4 emails a month to you. Highly targeted jobs that you may find interesting.

### spam_recruiting_company
A company that if you search the domain in your inbox you'll see dozens of emails usually sending multiple emails from multiple employees a day.

### inhouse_recruiting_company
A company recruiting to hire an employee for themselves. Normally these are hiring departments in larger corporations. These usually are the least intrusive and most interesting to look at.
